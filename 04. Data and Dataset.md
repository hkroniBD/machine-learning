# ðŸ“Š Lecture: Data and Datasets for Machine Learning

## ðŸ”¹ Why Learn About Data?

* Data is the **foundation of machine learning**.
* Models are only as good as the data used for training.
* Understanding **types of data**, **dataset sources**, and **processing methods** is critical before applying algorithms.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is Data in Machine Learning?

* **Data** = Information collected from the real world, stored in a structured or unstructured form, used to train ML models.
* Represented in **vectors, matrices, tables, text, images, audio, video, or sensor signals**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Data

1. **Structured Data**

   * Stored in tables (rows & columns).
   * Examples: Student scores, sales records, weather measurements.

2. **Unstructured Data**

   * Not organized in a fixed format.
   * Examples: Images, audio files, social media posts, medical scans.

3. **Semi-structured Data**

   * Partially organized (not strictly tabular but has tags/labels).
   * Examples: JSON files, XML data, logs.

4. **Categorical Data**

   * Data representing categories.
   * Example: Gender (Male/Female), Blood Group (A, B, AB, O).

5. **Numerical Data**

   * Data represented as numbers.
   * Example: Age, Salary, Temperature.

6. **Textual Data**

   * Natural language sentences.
   * Example: News articles, reviews.

7. **Image/Video/Audio Data**

   * Used in computer vision and speech recognition tasks.

## ðŸ”¹ Time Series Data vs Sample Data

### ðŸ•’ **Time Series Data**

* Data points collected over time at equal intervals.
* Example: Daily stock prices, hourly temperature, ECG signals.
* Characteristics:

  * Order matters (sequence is important).
  * Often shows trends, seasonality, or cycles.

**Processing for ML**:

* Normalization/standardization.
* Handling missing values.
* Feature engineering (lag features, moving averages).
* Use specialized models: RNN, LSTM, ARIMA.

---

### ðŸ“Š **Sample Data**

* Independent observations not tied to time sequence.
* Example: Studentsâ€™ exam results, survey responses.
* Characteristics:

  * Order does not matter.
  * Each row is an independent sample.

**Processing for ML**:

* Data cleaning (remove duplicates, handle missing values).
* Scaling features.
* Splitting into train/test sets.
* Use models like regression, decision trees, SVM.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How Do We Use Data in ML?

1. **Data Collection**

   * From sensors, databases, surveys, APIs, online repositories.

2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Remove missing values, duplicates, outliers.

3. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Normalization, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.

4. **Splitting**

   * Train set (to learn), Validation set (to tune), Test set (to evaluate).

## ðŸ”¹ Sources of Public Datasets

Here are reliable repositories where you can collect ML datasets:

* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) â€“ Rich collection of datasets across domains.
* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) â€“ Classic ML datasets widely used in research.
* [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) â€“ Search engine for datasets.
* [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) â€“ Open government data (USA).
* [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) â€“ Online platform for ML datasets and benchmarking.
* [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) â€“ Economic, financial, and global development data.
* [Awesome Public Datasets (GitHub)](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) â€“ Curated list of datasets.

---

âœ… **Summary**:

* ML requires understanding different types of data (structured, unstructured, categorical, numerical, time series).
* Time series data â‰  sample data; they need different preprocessing and models.
* Many free repositories exist to collect high-quality data.

Would you like me to also **add real case examples** (e.g., stock prediction for time series vs student grade prediction for sample data) into this lecture so your students can better visualize the difference?
