What Are AI Agents in Robotics? üöÄ

Definition: AI agents in robotics are computational systems that enable robots to autonomously or semi-autonomously interact with their environment using sensors, decision-making algorithms, and actuators.
Key Characteristics:

Decision-Making: Plan and execute actions based on goals or tasks.
Action: Perform physical or virtual tasks via actuators.
Learning: Adapt to new environments or tasks over time.


Examples: Autonomous drones, industrial robotic arms, humanoid robots like Boston Dynamics‚Äô Atlas, or service robots like Roomba.
