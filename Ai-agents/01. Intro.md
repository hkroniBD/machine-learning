## 1. Introduction: What is an AI Agent?

An **AI agent** is a computer system that perceives its environment through sensors, processes information, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals autonomously or semi-autonomously.

### Key Characteristics of AI Agents:
- **Autonomy**: Operates without direct human intervention
- **Reactivity**: Responds to changes in the environment
- **Proactivity**: Takes initiative to achieve goals
- **Social Ability**: Interacts with other agents or humans
- **Learning**: Adapts behavior based on experience

### The Agent-Environment Interaction Model:
```
Environment → [Sensors] → Agent → [Actuators] → Environment
```

The agent continuously:
1. **Perceives** the environment through sensors
2. **Processes** information using its reasoning capabilities
3. **Acts** upon the environment through actuators
4. **Learns** from the outcomes to improve future decisions

## 2. Types of AI Agents

### 2.1 Simple Reflex Agents
- **Behavior**: React to current percept only

### 2.2 Model-Based Reflex Agents
- **Behavior**: Maintain internal state/model of the world
- **Decision Making**: Consider current percept + internal state
- **Example**: Chess-playing program that remembers previous moves
- **Advantage**: Can handle partially observable environments

- **Behavior**: Work toward achieving specific goals
- **Decision Making**: Evaluate actions based on goal achievement
- **Example**: GPS navigation system, planning robots

### 2.4 Utility-Based Agents
- **Behavior**: Optimize for maximum utility/satisfaction
- **Decision Making**: Choose actions that maximize expected utility
- **Example**: Autonomous trading systems, resource allocation systems
- **Advantage**: Can handle conflicting goals and uncertainty

### 2.5 Learning Agents
- **Behavior**: Improve performance over time through experience
- **Components**: Learning element, performance element, critic, problem generator
- **Example**: Recommendation systems, adaptive game AI
- **Capability**: Self-improvement and adaptation
