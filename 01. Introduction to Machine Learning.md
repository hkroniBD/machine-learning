## **Lecture Contents**

### **1. What is Machine Learning?**

* **Formal Definition (Arthur Samuel, 1959):**
  *“ML is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.”*
* **Modern Definition:**
  *“Algorithms that improve their performance automatically through experience.”*

➡️ **Key Idea:** ML enables machines to generalize from examples rather than relying solely on hard-coded instructions.

### **2. Types of Machine Learning**

* **Supervised Learning**

  * Uses **labeled data** (input-output pairs).
  * Tasks: Classification, Regression.
  * Example: Predicting electricity demand based on historical data.

* **Unsupervised Learning**

  * Uses **unlabeled data**, discovers hidden patterns.
  * Tasks: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction.
  * Example: Grouping power consumption profiles of households.

* **Reinforcement Learning**

  * Learns by **trial and error** using **rewards/penalties**.
  * Example: Smart grid energy management with adaptive decisions.

### **3. Applications in Electrical & Computer Science**

* **Fault detection in power systems** → Classification models.
* **Load forecasting** → Regression, neural networks.
* **Renewable energy integration** → Time-series predictive models.
* **Image recognition in automation** → Computer vision models.
* **Anomaly detection in IoT devices** → Unsupervised ML.

---

### **4. Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning**

* **Traditional Programming**

  * Input: Rules + Data → Output.
  * Example: Hard-coded logic for circuit breaker operation.

* **Machine Learning**

  * Input: Data + Output → Model learns rules.
  * Example: Predictive maintenance in power transformers.

### **5. Environment Setup**

* **Python Installation**

  * Recommended: [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (comes with Python, Jupyter, and ML libraries).
* **Jupyter Notebook Basics**

  * Create cells, run Python code, write Markdown notes.
  * Official guide: [Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter.org/)
* **Google Colab**

  * Cloud-based alternative, no installation needed.
  * Free GPUs available for ML training.
  * Official site: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## **Hands-on / Activity**

### **Step 1: Install & Open Jupyter Notebook**

* Open **Anaconda Navigator → Jupyter Notebook**.

### **Step 2: First Python Code**

```python
print("Hello Machine Learning")
```

### **Step 3: Markdown Note-taking**

Example in Markdown Cell:

```markdown
# My First ML Notebook
- This is a note
- Machine Learning learns from data!
```

### **Step 4: Simple Example – Manual Rule vs ML**

**Traditional Approach (Rule-based):**

```python
def classify_voltage(voltage):
    if voltage > 220:
        return "High Voltage"
    else:
        return "Normal Voltage"

print(classify_voltage(230))
```

**ML-like Approach (Using Data):**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

# Example dataset: voltage levels (X) and labels (y)
X = np.array([[210], [220], [230], [240], [250]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1])  # 0=Normal, 1=High

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict new value
print("Prediction for 225V:", model.predict([[225]])[0])
```

## **Takeaway**

* ML is **data-driven learning** for prediction, classification, and automation.
* Unlike traditional programming, ML **discovers rules** from examples.
* Jupyter Notebook / Colab are essential environments for ML experiments.
