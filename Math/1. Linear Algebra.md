# ðŸ“˜ Lecture 1: Linear Algebra for Machine Learning (EEE Focus)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Motivation â€“ Why Linear Algebra in ML?

* ML handles **data in bulk** â†’ thousands of samples, many features.
* To manage this efficiently, ML represents data in **vectors and matrices**.
* Algorithms like **Linear Regression, PCA, Neural Networks** are basically linear algebra operations.

ðŸ’¡ **EEE Analogy:**

* Just like signals can be represented as vectors in Fourier space, data in ML is represented as vectors/matrices for computation.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Vectors â€“ Data Representation

* A **vector** is simply an ordered list of numbers.
* In ML â†’ one vector = one data sample.

Example (Student Performance Dataset):

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \\ 0.9 \end{bmatrix}
$$

* 5 = hours of study
* 7 = hours of sleep
* 0.9 = attendance

This **vector $x$** represents one studentâ€™s data.

EEE Example:

* Voltage readings at 3 time instants:

$$
v = \begin{bmatrix} 220 \\ 218 \\ 222 \end{bmatrix}
$$

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Matrices â€“ Dataset Representation

* A **matrix** = collection of vectors (multiple samples).
* Each row = one data sample; each column = one feature.

Example (3 students, 3 features):

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix} 
5 & 7 & 0.9 \\\\ 
6 & 6 & 0.8 \\\\ 
8 & 5 & 0.95 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

ðŸ’¡ This is exactly how data is stored in ML datasets.

EEE Example:

* Matrix of electrical readings (rows = times, columns = \[Voltage, Current, Power]).

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Vector Operations

### 4.1 Addition & Scaling

$$
u = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad v = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}
$$

* $u+v = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}$
* $2u = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$

ðŸ’¡ ML Use: Feature scaling, normalization.

### 4.2 Dot Product (Similarity)

$$
u \cdot v = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2
$$

* Measures similarity between two vectors.
* ML â†’ used in **cosine similarity** (recommendation systems).

EEE Example: Inner product = signal correlation (similarity of two waveforms).

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Matrix Operations

### 5.1 Multiplication

If:

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 7 \\\\ 6 & 6 \end{bmatrix}, \quad W = \begin{bmatrix} 0.4 \\\\ 0.6 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Then:

$$
y = XW = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 7 \\\\ 6 & 6 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.4 \\\\ 0.6 \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} 5.8 \\\\ 6.0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

ðŸ’¡ ML Use: Prediction (Linear Regression, Neural Networks).

EEE Analogy: Like multiplying admittance matrix $Y$ with voltage vector $V$ to get current vector $I$.

### 5.2 Transpose

* Swap rows â†” columns.
* Used in ML for matrix alignments in formulas.

### 5.3 Inverse

* For square matrices.
* In ML â†’ used to solve equations (Normal Equation in regression).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Special Concepts

### 6.1 Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors

* Eigenvector = special direction that doesnâ€™t change under transformation.
* Eigenvalue = how much it stretches/shrinks.

ML Use: **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** â€“ reduces data dimensions.

EEE Example: In vibration analysis of electrical machines â†’ mode shapes are eigenvectors.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Case Study: ML with Linear Algebra

**Problem:** Predict power consumption (P) from Voltage (V), Current (I), Temperature (T).

1. Represent dataset as matrix $X$:

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix} V & I & T \end{bmatrix}
$$

2. Define model:

$$
P = XW + b
$$

3. Matrix multiplication â†’ compute predictions for all samples at once.
4. Optimize weights $W$ using calculus (next lecture).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Key Takeaways

* **Vector = single data point**
* **Matrix = dataset**
* **Dot product = similarity**
* **Matrix multiplication = model predictions**
* **Eigenvectors = data compression (PCA)**

ðŸ’¡ Linear Algebra is the **foundation of ML models** â€“ without it, data cannot be represented or processed efficiently.
