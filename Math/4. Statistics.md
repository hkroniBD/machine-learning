# 📘 Lecture 4: Statistics for Machine Learning

---

## 🌟 Icebreaker

💡 *“When you test a new electronic sensor, do you believe one measurement — or do you repeat many times?”*
👉 That repetition is where **statistics** matters.

---

## 🔹 Why Statistics in ML?

* 📊 ML models rely on **data patterns**, not single numbers.
* 🧮 Statistics helps:

  * Understanding **data distribution**
  * Detecting **noise vs. signal**
  * Making **predictions with uncertainty**

---

## 📌 Core Topics

### 1️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

* **Mean (µ)** → Central tendency of data

  $$
  \mu = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i
  $$
* **Median** → Middle value, less sensitive to outliers
* **Variance (σ²)** → Spread of data

  $$
  \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2
  $$
* **Standard Deviation (σ)** → Noise level in data

📌 **Example (EEE)**:

* Current sensor readings: 10.1A, 9.9A, 10.2A, 10.0A
* Mean current = **10.05 A**
* Std. dev. shows **how stable the sensor is**

---

### 2️⃣ Probability Distributions

* **Normal Distribution**: Many natural processes follow it (noise, measurements).

  * Bell-shaped curve, defined by mean (µ) & variance (σ²).
* **Uniform Distribution**: Equal probability (e.g., random initialization of weights).
* **Binomial / Bernoulli**: Success/failure cases (EEE: relay switching ON/OFF).

📌 **Example (EEE)**:

* Noise in voltage signals often modeled as **Gaussian (Normal) distribution**.

---

### 3️⃣ Correlation & Covariance

* **Covariance**: Do two variables move together?

  $$
  \text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{1}{N}\sum (x_i - \mu_X)(y_i - \mu_Y)
  $$
* **Correlation (r)**: Normalized covariance

  * r close to **+1** → Strong positive relation
  * r close to **-1** → Strong negative relation

📌 **Example (EEE)**:

* Power consumption vs. temperature of equipment → Strong correlation.

---

### 4️⃣ Hypothesis Testing (Decision Making)

* Used to **validate assumptions**.
* **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No effect, no relation.
* **Alternative (H₁)**: There is an effect/relation.
* p-value → Probability that results are due to chance.

📌 **Example (EEE)**:

* Testing if a **new ML algorithm** really improves fault detection accuracy in substations.

---

## 🧩 Applications in Machine Learning

* Data preprocessing → Detecting **outliers & noise**.
* Feature selection → Choosing variables with **high correlation** to target.
* Model evaluation → Using **statistical tests** to confirm improvements.
* Uncertainty estimation → Predicting with **confidence intervals**.

---

## ✅ Quick Summary

* **Statistics = Language of data**.
* Helps ML in: describing, understanding, and validating data.
* EEE relevance: noise analysis, reliability checks, fault detection, load forecasting.

## ❓ Objective Viva Questions

1. Mean and standard deviation are used to measure:
   a) Central tendency and spread
   b) Correlation and covariance
   c) Probability and distribution
   d) Hypothesis and testing

2. Which distribution models random noise in electrical signals?
   a) Uniform
   b) Normal (Gaussian)
   c) Binomial
   d) Exponential

3. Correlation coefficient close to 0 means:
   a) Strong relation
   b) No relation
   c) Perfect prediction
   d) Hypothesis is rejected

---

## ✅ Solutions

1. **a** – Mean = central tendency, Std. dev. = spread.
2. **b** – Noise is usually modeled as Gaussian.
3. **b** – Near zero correlation = no linear relation.

HK Roni Sir, would you like me to now **add simple plots (Normal distribution curve, correlation scatter, sensor data variance)** for this lecture, so that your students can **visualize statistics better** instead of just reading equations?
