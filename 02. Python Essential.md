# Getting Started with Python for Machine Learning

## Introduction 🌟
This second lecture focuses on essential Python programming concepts to get you started with Python, especially in the context of machine learning. We'll cover basic syntax, data structures, control flow, functions, and key libraries. Each section includes code examples followed by relevant practice problems to reinforce your learning.

**Note**: Python is case-sensitive, and indentation matters for code blocks. Use a Python interpreter or IDE like Jupyter Notebook to run the code.

## Variables and Data Types 📝
Variables store data, and Python supports various data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

```python
# Assigning variables
age = 25  # Integer
height = 5.9  # Float
name = "Alice"  # String
is_student = True  # Boolean

# Printing values
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is Student:", is_student)
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Create variables for your name, age, and favorite number. Print them in a sentence.
2. Convert a float to an integer and observe the result (e.g., int(3.7)).
3. Check the type of a variable using type() function and print it for different data types.

## Operators 🧮
Operators perform arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operations.

```python
# Arithmetic operators
a = 10
b = 3
print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)
print("Modulo:", a % b)

# Comparison operators
print("Is a > b?", a > b)

# Logical operators
print("True and False:", True and False)
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Calculate the area of a rectangle using length and width variables with multiplication.
2. Use comparison operators to check if a number is even or odd (hint: use % 2 == 0).
3. Combine logical operators to check if a number is between 10 and 20 inclusive.

## Control Flow: If-Else Statements 🔀
Control flow structures like if-else help make decisions based on conditions.

```python
# If-else example
number = 15
if number > 10:
    print("Number is greater than 10")
elif number == 10:
    print("Number is equal to 10")
else:
    print("Number is less than 10")
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18).
2. Create a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the operation.
3. Determine if a year is a leap year (divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless by 400).

## Loops: For and While 🔄
Loops allow repeating code blocks.

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration:", i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Use a for loop to print the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Write a while loop to sum numbers from 1 to 100.
3. Create a loop that prints even numbers between 1 and 20.

## Functions 📦
Functions encapsulate reusable code.

```python
# Defining a function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
print(greet("Bob"))

# Function with default parameter
def add(x, y=5):
    return x + y

print(add(3))  # Uses default y=5
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
2. Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
3. Define a function to find the maximum of three numbers.

## Lists and Tuples 📋
Lists are mutable collections; tuples are immutable.

```python
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")
print("Fruits:", fruits)
print("First fruit:", fruits[0])

# Tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print("Colors:", colors)
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Create a list of numbers and sort it in ascending order.
2. Write code to reverse a list without using built-in functions.
3. Use a tuple to store coordinates (x, y) and unpack them into variables.

## Dictionaries and Sets 🗂️
Dictionaries store key-value pairs; sets store unique items.

```python
# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Charlie", "age": 30}
print("Name:", person["name"])
person["city"] = "New York"
print("Person:", person)

# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3}
print("Unique Numbers:", unique_numbers)
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Create a dictionary for a student's grades and calculate the average.
2. Use a set to find unique elements in a list.
3. Merge two dictionaries and print the result.

## File Handling 📂
Reading and writing files is essential for data processing.

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File Content:", content)
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Write a program to count the number of words in a text file.
2. Append a new line to an existing file and read the updated content.
3. Create a CSV file with sample data and read it back.

## Introduction to NumPy for ML 🔢
NumPy is crucial for numerical computations in ML.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print("Array:", arr)

# Array operations
print("Mean:", np.mean(arr))
print("Squared:", arr ** 2)
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Create a 2D NumPy array and compute its transpose.
2. Generate a random array of 10 numbers and find the min and max.
3. Perform element-wise multiplication on two arrays.

## Introduction to Pandas for ML 📊
Pandas handles data frames for data manipulation.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame
data = {"Name": ["David", "Eve"], "Age": [28, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("DataFrame:\n", df)

# Accessing data
print("Ages:\n", df["Age"])
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Load a sample CSV into a DataFrame and print summary statistics.
2. Filter a DataFrame to show rows where Age > 25.
3. Add a new column to a DataFrame and save it to a file.
