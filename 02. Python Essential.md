# Getting Started with Python for Machine Learning 📚

## Overview 🌟
This lecture provides a hands-on introduction to Python programming, focusing on foundational concepts essential for machine learning (ML). We'll cover variables, operators, control flow, loops, functions, data structures, file handling, and key ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas). Each section includes a brief explanation of basics, code examples, and practice problems to reinforce learning.

**Note**: Python is case-sensitive, and indentation (usually 4 spaces) defines code blocks. Use an IDE like Jupyter Notebook to run and experiment with the code.

## Variables and Data Types 📝
**Definition**: Variables are named containers for storing data values. Python supports various data types, dynamically assigned without explicit declaration.

**Basics**:
- **Integer**: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3).
- **Float**: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).
- **String**: Text data enclosed in quotes (e.g., "hello").
- **Boolean**: True or False values.
- **NoneType**: Represents absence of a value (None).
- Variables are created using `=` (e.g., `x = 10`).
- Use `type()` to check a variable’s data type.

```python
# Variable assignments
age = 25  # Integer
height = 5.9  # Float
name = "Alice"  # String
is_student = True  # Boolean
nothing = None  # NoneType

# Printing values and types
print("Name:", name, "Type:", type(name))
print("Age:", age, "Type:", type(age))
print("Height:", height, "Type:", type(height))
print("Is Student:", is_student, "Type:", type(is_student))
print("Nothing:", nothing, "Type:", type(nothing))
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Create variables for your name (string), age (integer), and height (float). Print them with their types.
2. Convert a float to an integer (e.g., `int(3.7)`) and print the result.
3. Create a variable with `None` and check its type using `type()`.

## Operators 🧮
**Definition**: Operators perform operations on variables and values, enabling arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment tasks.

**Basics**:
- **Arithmetic**: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `//` (floor division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation).
- **Comparison**: `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=`, `<=`.
- **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `not`.
- **Assignment**: `=` (assign), `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` (compound assignments).

```python
# Arithmetic operators
a = 10
b = 3
print("Addition:", a + b)  # 13
print("Division:", a / b)  # 3.333...
print("Floor Division:", a // b)  # 3
print("Modulo:", a % b)  # 1

# Comparison and logical operators
print("Is a > b?", a > b)  # True
print("True and False:", True and False)  # False
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Calculate the area of a rectangle using length and width with multiplication.
2. Check if a number is divisible by 5 using the modulo operator (`%`).
3. Use logical operators to check if a number is positive and even.

## Control Flow: If-Else Statements 🔀
**Definition**: Control flow statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else` execute code blocks based on conditions.

**Basics**:
- **If**: Executes code if a condition is True.
- **Elif**: Checks additional conditions if the previous ones are False.
- **Else**: Executes code if no conditions are True.
- Conditions use comparison or logical operators.
- Syntax: `if condition:`, followed by indented code block.

```python
# If-else example
number = 15
if number > 10:
    print("Number is greater than 10")
elif number == 10:
    print("Number is equal to 10")
else:
    print("Number is less than 10")
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Write a program to check if a person can vote (age >= 18).
2. Create a program to assign grades (A, B, C, etc.) based on a score (e.g., >=90 is A).
3. Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-elif-else.

## Loops: For and While 🔄
**Definition**: Loops repeat code blocks until a condition is met or a sequence is exhausted.

**Basics**:
- **For Loop**: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, range).
  - Syntax: `for variable in sequence:`.
  - `range(start, stop, step)` generates numbers.
- **While Loop**: Repeats as long as a condition is True.
  - Syntax: `while condition:`.
- Use `break` to exit a loop early, `continue` to skip an iteration.

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):  # 0 to 4
    print("Iteration:", i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Use a for loop to print multiples of 3 from 3 to 30.
2. Write a while loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.
3. Create a loop to print odd numbers from 1 to 20, skipping even numbers with `continue`.

## Functions 📦
**Definition**: Functions are reusable code blocks that perform a specific task, defined using `def`.

**Basics**:
- Syntax: `def function_name(parameters):`.
- **Parameters**: Inputs to the function (optional).
- **Return**: Outputs a value (optional; defaults to `None`).
- **Default Parameters**: Predefined values for parameters.
- **Scope**: Variables defined in a function are local unless specified otherwise.

```python
# Defining a function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Function with default parameter
def add(x, y=5):
    return x + y

print(greet("Bob"))  # Hello, Bob!
print(add(3))  # 8 (3 + 5)
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Write a function to compute the square of a number and return it.
2. Create a function that takes a string and returns its length.
3. Define a function to find the minimum of two numbers with a default value of 0 for the second number.

## Lists and Tuples 📋
**Definition**: Lists and tuples are ordered collections of items; lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.

**Basics**:
- **List**: Defined with `[]`, supports adding/removing items.
  - Methods: `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`.
  - Access: Indexing (`list[0]`) and slicing (`list[1:3]`).
- **Tuple**: Defined with `()`, immutable after creation.
  - Access: Same as lists, but cannot modify contents.
- **Length**: Use `len()` for both.

```python
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")
print("Fruits:", fruits)  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
print("First fruit:", fruits[0])  # apple

# Tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print("Colors:", colors)  # ('red', 'green', 'blue')
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Create a list of 5 numbers and calculate their sum using a loop.
2. Write code to swap the first and last elements of a list.
3. Create a tuple of months and print a slice containing the first three months.

## Dictionaries and Sets 🗂️
**Definition**: Dictionaries store key-value pairs; sets store unique items.

**Basics**:
- **Dictionary**: Defined with `{}`, keys are unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers).
  - Access: `dict[key]`.
  - Methods: `get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `update()`.
- **Set**: Defined with `set()` or `{}`, stores unique items, unordered.
  - Operations: `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`.
  - Methods: `add()`, `remove()`.

```python
# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Charlie", "age": 30}
person["city"] = "New York"
print("Person:", person)  # {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3}
print("Unique Numbers:", unique_numbers)  # {1, 2, 3}
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Create a dictionary for a car (model, year, color) and print its keys and values.
2. Use a set to find common elements between two lists.
3. Update a dictionary with a new key-value pair and remove an existing key.

## File Handling 📂
**Definition**: File handling involves reading from and writing to files for data storage and retrieval.

**Basics**:
- **Modes**: `r` (read), `w` (write, overwrites), `a` (append), `r+` (read/write).
- **Context Manager**: Use `with` to automatically close files.
- **Methods**: `read()`, `write()`, `readlines()`, `writelines()`.
- Common file types: text (`.txt`), CSV (`.csv`).

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File Content:", content)  # Hello, Python!
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Write a program to write a list of names to a text file.
2. Read a text file and count the number of lines.
3. Create a CSV file with student data (name, score) and read it back.

## Introduction to NumPy for ML 🔢
**Definition**: NumPy is a library for numerical computing, providing support for arrays and mathematical operations.

**Basics**:
- **Array**: Multi-dimensional array object (`np.array()`).
- **Operations**: Element-wise arithmetic, aggregation (e.g., `mean()`, `sum()`).
- **Features**: Broadcasting, indexing, slicing, random number generation.
- Install: `pip install numpy`.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print("Array:", arr)

# Array operations
print("Mean:", np.mean(arr))  # 2.5
print("Squared:", arr ** 2)  # [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Create a 3x3 NumPy array and print its shape.
2. Generate a random array of 5 numbers between 0 and 1 using `np.random.rand()`.
3. Compute the dot product of two arrays using `np.dot()`.

## Introduction to Pandas for ML 📊
**Definition**: Pandas is a library for data manipulation, providing DataFrame and Series objects.

**Basics**:
- **DataFrame**: 2D table with rows and columns, like a spreadsheet.
- **Series**: 1D array-like structure, like a column in a DataFrame.
- **Features**: Filtering, grouping, merging, handling missing data.
- Install: `pip install pandas`.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame
data = {"Name": ["David", "Eve"], "Age": [28, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("DataFrame:\n", df)

# Accessing data
print("Ages:\n", df["Age"])
```

**Practice Problems**:
1. Create a DataFrame from a dictionary of student names and grades, then print rows where grades > 80.
2. Load a CSV file into a DataFrame and drop rows with missing values using `dropna()`.
3. Group a DataFrame by a column and compute the mean of another column.
